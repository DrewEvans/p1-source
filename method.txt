My Method - Ma Maison
I split my work up by page

#1 Home page
- review the mockups & visualise the html semantics
- then box off the components (nav,search,product cards)
- setup the dev env (html boilerplate, add stylesheet, update title, test stylesheet)
- Start writing my markup & giving each element respectable class Name, from top - down (nav, section, main, products).
- I create the additional pages for product & about. 
- I then link any product cards to their respectable pages
- Once all anchor elements have been added I add the HTML to one of product pages
- Next is to add the css to product page
- copy the html from one product page to the other and update the content & images
